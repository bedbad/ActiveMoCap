# ActiveMoCap
The code for the CVPR 2020 paper "ActiveMoCap: Optimized Viewpoint Selection for Active Human Motion Capture" by Sena Kiciroglu, Helge Rhodin, Sudipta Sinha, Mathieu Salzmann, and Pascal Fua.

You can cite the paper as: 

    @inproceedings{rhodin2019neural,
      author = {Rhodin, Helge and Constantin, Victor and Katircioglu Isinsu and Salzmann, Mathieu and Fua, Pascal},
      booktitle = {CVPR},
      title = {Neural Scene Decomposition for Multi-Person Motion Capture},
      year = {2019}
    }


Details on the set-up and the publicly available code is coming soon!
